## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In this project I would love to see if there is a pattern in the medical charges for people given the several different characteristics this dataset has to offer. This dataset was specifically intriguing because of a few factors: the first being the fact that its usability was rated 8.8 and was widely used (61.3k downloads) which meant it would most likely be a very reliable source for our project which will definitely be needed in order for the project to go smoothly in later milestones, and the second being the dataset topic itself being quite intriguing as it will be cool to see if there is a correlation between all these factors, which factors weigh the heaviest on insurance costs, etc. I speculate that the largest factor of insurance costs will definitely be related to age. Questions I'd like to explore are: are there any relevant correlation between the ratio of multiple quantitative variables; such as age/bmi vs charges/children? Can we see the regions with the oldest populations and highest charges? What would be the most dominant variable in determining costs of the insurance charges?

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data was extracted from the textbook "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz. The data consists of the age, sex, bmi, children (y/n), smoker (y/n), region, and charges for people with medical insurance, for a total of 7 variables and 1339 rows (9373 total values). The latest version of this data was updated as of 2 years ago and the first version was uploaded 3 years ago. The purpose of this dataset was to see if you could accurately predict, or if there is a pattern, in health insurance costs given the said factors for specific people. Unfortunately, the given information about this dataset does not mention the way of data collection, although I would believe it would be taken from medical logs given the type of data that this dataset consists of.
